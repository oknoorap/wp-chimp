> Lean MailChimp subscription form plugin for WordPress

## Description

WP Chimp provides the ability to add a MailChimp subscription form to your post and page content and in the Widget area. The plugin also registers a custom [Gutenberg Block](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/language/) allowing you to add and edit the subscription form in a much more intuitive way, which will not be possible when using the Shortcode.

This plugin focuses on simplicity, user experience, and speed. We ensure to provide seamless integration to MailChimp services, ease of use with an interface that complies with WordPress design guidelines, and that it would work at scale.
